How to run?
 python Naive_Bayes.py

 for testing accuracy on learning curv change with training set size and testing accuracy on val of m, I use same code, just comment some code when testing.
 1. For testing learning curv with train set size , use splits, then set m = 0 and m = 1 
 	seperately, to get the accuracy result
 2. For testing performance with m, comment splits and related code, use m = (0.0, 0.1, 
 	....,10) to get accuracy list
